gunt-badge
==========

Add a gunt badge to any website by including a single JavaScript file.


Usage
-------------
Just save the `gunt-badge.min.js` file from this repository into your project, and add the following line of JavaScript to the site

    <script src="path/to/gunt-badge.min.js"></script>

You don't need to do anything else, the script will automatically initialise when the page has finished loading.

It loads an image from the main guntlondon.com website, you may want to change this to load the image file locally. The URL to this image is set as a variable at the start of the file.

    
Example
-------
This repo contains an example HTML page that shows how to use the script.


Source
------
This repo also contains the source code. If you make a change, the minified file needs to be manually recompiled. You can use an [online compressor](http://refresh-sf.com/yui/)
