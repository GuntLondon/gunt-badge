looser-badge
==========

Add a looser badge to any website by including a single JavaScript file.


Usage
-------------

Just add the following line of JavaScript to a site:

    <script src="https://madebyloosers.github.io/looser-badge/looser-badge.min.js"></script>

You don't need to do anything else, the script will automatically initialise when the page has finished loading.


Example
-------

This repo contains an example HTML page that shows how to use the script.


Source
------

This repo also contains the source code. If you make a change, the minified file needs to be manually recompiled. You can use an [online compressor](http://refresh-sf.com/)
